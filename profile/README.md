## PRISMA (Pattern Recognition and Inference: Signals → Models → Applications)

We strive to uncover meaningful patterns from scattered data. 

We are a multi-disciplinary, multi-national research group in Groningen focused on pushing the boundaries of computer vision. Our work includes applications in biology, medicine, forensics, and radio astronomy.

The code for our project can be found in this page. All of our projects are shared using a GNU-GPLv3 license. We kindly ask that you attribute us if you find our work useful for your own.
